##  About this blog
Eric Steven Raymond said:
> The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople.   

and I want to be one of the heroes, that's why I started this blog. Because I love helping people by sharing my humble knowledge.
